4.  **Logout**: Click the "Logout" button in the header to return to the login screen. Your tasks will remain saved for your username.

## Styling & Design

The application utilizes a **glassmorphism** design, characterized by frosted glass effects, translucency, and subtle shadows. This aesthetic is achieved using CSS properties like `backdrop-filter: blur()`, `rgba()` colors, and `box-shadow`.

Global CSS variables defined in `src/App.css` are used to manage colors and theme-specific values, allowing for a seamless **Dark Mode** toggle across the application.

Custom styles for the `react-datepicker` are applied in `src/styles/DatePickerCustom.css` to integrate it visually with the app's glassmorphism theme and ensure proper layering.

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Replace `localStorage` with a proper database and API for multi-device sync and more robust data handling.
- **User Accounts**: Implement full user registration and authentication with secure password handling.
- **Task Sorting**: Add options to sort tasks by due date, priority, or creation date.
- **Notifications**: Implement browser notifications for upcoming task due dates.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search tasks by keywords in title, description, or tags.
- **Tag Management**: A dedicated interface for managing tags.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Allow reordering of tasks within the list.
- **More Advanced Filters**: Filter by priority, date range, or specific tags.
